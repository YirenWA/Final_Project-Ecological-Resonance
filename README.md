### Note: 
To run the script within the Blender file, it is necessary to establish a TCP server and import OpenCV.

## WEEK1
This week is primarily focused on establishing the background, theme, content, and form of the artwork.

### Inspiration  
The inspiration comes from daily life. Through observation, I have noticed that people leave many imprints in the physical 

### About Work  
 _participants will be guided to explore the digital world using physical actions in the real world and leave imprints in the digital space._ 
## WEEK2
This week is 
生物模型设计，使用线条

进行了大量的几何节点建模工作

## WEEK3
This week is 
贴图，渲染，控制运动形态的节点选择

## WEEK4
This week is 
控制几何节点输入端口
## WEEK5
This week is 
OpenCV 图像灰度化和二值化处理

## WEEK6

小的沙子覆盖测试

## WEEK7
This week is 主要是在装置场景搭建设计
To create an immersive experience, I made a sand model to simulate urban crevices. 同时是围栏，也可以限制沙子不会跑出范围。

为了贴合显示屏的曲面，将它稳固在位置上，做了一个支撑。
